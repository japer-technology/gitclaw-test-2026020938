Sunlight is White Light\nSunlight contains **all colors** of the visible spectrum — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet — each with a different wavelength:\n- 🔴 Red: ~700 nm (long wavelength)\n- 🟠 Orange: ~600 nm\n- 🟡 Yellow: ~580 nm\n- 🟢 Green: ~520 nm\n- 🔵 Blue: ~470 nm (short wavelength)\n- 🟣 Violet: ~400 nm (shortest)\n\n### 2. Rayleigh Scattering\nWhen sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with tiny gas molecules (mainly nitrogen and oxygen). **Shorter wavelengths scatter far more** than longer ones — the scattering intensity is proportional to **1/λ⁴** (inverse fourth power of wavelength).\n\nThis means blue light (~470 nm) scatters about **5.5× more** than red light (~700 nm).\n\n### 3. Why Blue and Not Violet?\nViolet light scatters even more than blue, but:\n- The sun emits **less violet** light than blue\n- Our eyes are **more sensitive to blue** than violet\n- Some violet light gets **absorbed** in the upper atmosphere\n\nSo we perceive the sky as **blue**.\n\n### 4. Why Sunsets Are Red/Orange 🌅\nAt sunset, sunlight travels through **much more atmosphere**. Most blue light gets scattered away before reaching your eyes, leaving the longer-wavelength **reds and oranges**.\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, I can't generate or display pictures — I'm a text-based coding assistant with access to file tools and a terminal. I don't have image generation capabilities. \n\nHowever, if you'd like, I could:\n- **Create an HTML page** with diagrams (using SVG/CSS) illustrating Rayleigh scattering\n- **Find and download** a public domain diagram from the web\n\nWould you like me to do either of those?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":2352,"output":600,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":2952,"cost":{"input":0.011760000000000001,"output":0.015000000000000001,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.026760000000000003}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771627516779}}
